The base blob of structured data is BTC-2009:
    link: http://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/btc-2009/
    format: n-quads, plaintext file with triple+grap on every line, like:
        <http://one.example/subject1> <http://one.example/predicate1> <http://one.example/object1> <http://example.org/graph3>.
    size: 17GiB, or 2,2GiB for testing

For queries (relations/topics and examples) three sets were used:
    SemSearch'11
        topics
            link: http://km.aifb.kit.edu/ws/semsearch10/Files/samplequeries-list
            full list (50 topics) is not available
        examples
            evaluation data (qrels) as URIs was used as examples, but is not available

    INEX’07 and INEX’08
        '07 and '08 not available, newer are though
        link: https://inex.mmci.uni-saarland.de/data/documentcollection.html#lod

            a lot of them
        examples
